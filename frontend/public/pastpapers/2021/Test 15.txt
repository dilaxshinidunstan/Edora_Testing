			The World's Oldest First Grader 
	On January 12, 2004, Kimani Himani Maruge knocked on the door of the primary school 
in his village in Kenya. It was the first day of his school, and he was ready to start learning. The teacher let him in and gave him a desk. The new student sat down with the rest of the first graders-six and seven year old boys and girls. However, Kimani Maruge was not an ordinary first grader. 
He was 84 years old, the world’s oldest first grader. 

	In 2003, when the Kenyan government began offering free primary education to everyone and Maruge wanted an education, too.  However, it wasn't always easy to Maruge to attend school like other children. But with the help of his school principal, Jane Obinchu, he was able to stay in school. 

	Maruge was a motivated and successful student. In fact, he was one of the top five students in his first grade class. In the second grade, Maruge became a prefect in his school. Over the years, Maruge  studied  Swahili,  English  and  Mathematics.  He  wanted  to  use  his  education  to  read religious books and to study veterinary medicine. 

	In 2005, Maruge flew in a plane for the first time in his life he travelled to the New York City, where he gave a speech at the United Nations. He spoke about the importance of education and asked for help to educate the people of Kenya. Maruge also wanted to improve primary education for children in Africa. 

	Maruge died in 2009, at the age of 89. However, his story lives on. The 2010 movie ‘The First Grader’ showed Maruge’s amazing fight to get an education. Many older Kenyans decided to start school after seeing ‘The First Grader’. One of those 19 year old Thoma Litei said, ‘I knew that it was not too late. I wanted to read and to know more language, so I came to learn’. That is why it is important for his story to be known.
